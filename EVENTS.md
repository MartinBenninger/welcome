## How it started
The initial idea of such a community started when the _DACH* Jazz User Group_ was founded and started to grow. We started to meet twice a year to exchange information and know how, whereas every time a different company hosted the event.<br>
> DACH = Apronym for **D**eutschland (Germany), **A**ustria and **C**onfoederatio **H**elvetica (latin: Switzerland)
