## What is already available
The number of repositories has grown significantly over the last months. We aim to help you to find interesting repositories by grouping them into different sections.

### Rational Team Concert
#### Work Item

#### Git Integration
Git has become the leading Version Control System over the last years, especially when it comes to open source software. One of its key success factors are great tools like GitHub that are based on Git. Companies that are operating RTC are more and more faced with the challenge to couple git based VCS like GitLab or GitHub with the Jazz Platform. 
The following extensions aim to fill or shrink the burdens for users that use both RTC and git based VCS tools:
- [Git Commit Picker](https://github.com/jazz-community/rtc-git-commit-picker) - Link Git Commits with RTC Work Items out of the Work Item Editor 
- An enhanced, web hook based GitLab integration will follow soon...

#### Dashboard Widgets
Project and team dashboards help you to have all your necessary information at a glance. RTC and JRS deliver many useful widgets and reports, but for some specific use cases, custom widgets are needed. The following are provided by us:
- [Timebox Planning](https://github.com/jazz-community/rtc-timeboxplanning) - Timeboxing is a widely used planning technique. The timebox planning widget is a feature rich widget which simplifies sprint planning, for both Scrum and SAFe based projects
- [Absence Widget](https://github.com/jazz-community/rtc-absence-widget) - Display scheduled absences of one or multiple teams in a compact way

### Doors Next Generation
