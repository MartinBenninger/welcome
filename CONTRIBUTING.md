## Suggesting enhancements
Our goal is to improve the Jazz plattform together with you, and we need your ideas to keep on improving.

## Reporting bugs
Choose the repository that you think the bug belongs to most, and create an issue there. It is easiest to create a separate issue for every bug that you encounter.

The following is not a mandatory list of information, but a recommendation of what can make sense to include in your issue. Include what you think is crucial to best demonstrate your problem, and help your fellow community members in finding a solution.

- **Use a descriptive title**
- **Include clear steps to reproduce the problem.** Include as much information as possible.
- **Provide information about your system**, the version you are experiencing problems with, the environment you are using, your operating system etc.
- **Explain where and how your experienced behavior differs from what you expected**
- **Include screenshots** to provide more information and context
- **Add as much context as possible** in any way you see fit and neccessary.
